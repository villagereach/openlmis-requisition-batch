# The License Header

Each java or javascript file in the codebase should be annotated with the 
proper copyright header. This header should be also applied to singnificant html files.

We use checkstyle to check for it being present in Java files. We also check for
it during our Grunt build in javascript files.

The current copyright header format can be found [here.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenLMIS/openlmis-ref-distro/master/LICENSE-HEADER)

Replace the year and holder with appropriate holder, for example:
